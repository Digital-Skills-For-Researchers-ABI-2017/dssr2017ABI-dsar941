## Synopsis

In this project we will develop a web-based epithelial transport discovery, exploration and assembly tool. Using this tool, users would be able to discover computational physiology models in order to assemble and create an epithelial model.

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

This project would be useful for novice modellers to make epithelial models. We will develop the following features:
* Model discovery - users will search models of interest and the tool will render some useful information of the models from the Physiome Model Repository such as species, gene, protein.
* Load models - list of selected models. This also has visualization feature to compare between cellml models. Also, users would be able to view annotated content from cellml such as abstract of the paper, author names.
* Epithelial Platform - interactive epithelial platform where users would be able to drag and drop transporters, channels across different membranes.

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Clone the project and open the index.html into your browser. Or you could copy and paste the index.html page URI into rawgit.com, which will provide you a web URI.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
