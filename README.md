## Synopsis

In this project we have developed a web-based epithelial transport discovery, exploration and assembly tool. Using this tool, users would be able to discover computational physiology models in order to create an epithelial model. 

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

This project would be useful for novice modellers to make epithelial models. We have developed the following features:
* Model discovery - users will search models of interest and it will show species, gene, protein, etc in addition to the cellml model name.
* Load models - list of selected models. This also has the visualization feature for comparison between cellml models. Also, users would be able to view annotated content from cellml such as abstract of the paper, author names, etc.
* Epithelial Platform - interactive epithelial platform where users can drag and drop transporters, channels and plat them in different membranes......

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
